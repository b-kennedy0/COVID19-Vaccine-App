## An app to show the progression of UK COVID-19 Vaccinations

---  
[Launch App](https://bradk.co.uk/covid)

---  

### About
The app was created to enable the centralised sharing of UK-wide vaccination progress. Each NHS service (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) are each publishing their vaccination data and this is collated into the <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk" target="_blank">Government Dashboard</a>. The Government Dashboard isn't the clearest at presenting the vaccine data so this app was created to do that. Created using R and RStudio.

### Design
The app was designed to  run in a web browser on all device types. It is aimed to be as clear and simple as possible.

### Data
The data for the app is refreshed daily as the NHS services publish their data. <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" target="_blank">View data source.</a> Although the data is pulled daily, depending on what time you view the app, it is possible that the data is one/two days old as the latest data has not yet been published.
