### About
The app was created to share UK-wide vaccination progress. Every day, each NHS service is publishing their data, collated on the <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk" target="_blank">Government Dashboard</a>. However, the government dashboard isn't the easiest to use and so this app was created to do that.

---

### Design
The app was coded using R, RStudio and ShinyApps. It is designed to run in a web browser on all device types with the aim of being as clear and simple as possible.

---

### Data
The data is refreshed daily. However, depending on when you view the app, it is possible that the data is one/two days old as the latest data has not yet been published.
Population data is estimated from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS).
